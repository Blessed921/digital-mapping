This is a web-based digital mapping application that integrates the Google Maps API
to display an interactive map centered on London by default. 
It includes geolocation functionality that automatically detects and centers the map on the userâ€™s current location, marking it with a custom pin. 
A default marker is also placed on the initial location. This app provides a foundational setup for location-based services, travel apps, or any application needing real-time map visualization and user positioning.
